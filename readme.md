# Software Engineering Project: FoodElf
****
**Purpose: To provide a system that restaurant customers could use to make the process of splitting a group bill easier, while also assisting the restaurant management in keeping track of sales and inventory consumption to better run their restaurant**

Description: This was a project that I worked on for my Software Engineering elective course. I worked with two other classmates to develop this bill sharing application, into a much broader system that implements more features and benefits both the customers and the restaurant management. This project consisted of a mobile application(client-side) for the customers to create group bills, split them, and pay them, as well as a web application(server-side) for the restaurant staff to manage bills, keep track of inventory, and analyze sales.

This repository contains all the code I wrote for the web application, which utilizes HTML,CSS and JavaScript for the front-end and Python for the back-end. I learned some HTML,CSS and JavaScript during the development of this project, as well as how to use a relational database management system.

*Programming Languages Used:*
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python

*Frameworks:*
- Django

*Databases:*
- SQLite3

*Libraries:*
- Chart.js
- TensorFlow**

**(used for implementation of machine learning to analyze sales data and customer preference data. This was in effort to offer customers meal suggestions based on their preferences and other people's choices who had similar preferences)
